## 💡 Why We Built This

We talk to Alexa and Siri daily — so why are we still clicking and typing to shop online?

**VerbaShop** was built to change that. We imagined a world where:

- You can help someone cook and order groceries at the same time.
- People with visual impairments can shop independently.
- Conversations, not clicks, drive commerce.

---

## 🛍️ What VerbaShop Does

With VerbaShop, you can:

- 🎙️ Say **"I need running shoes"** and get smart product suggestions.  
- 🎁 Ask **"What's good for a birthday gift?"** and receive personalized ideas.  
- 🛒 Complete your entire purchase using just your voice.

It’s inclusive by design — perfect for users who find traditional websites difficult to use.

- **Supabase** – backend data and product storage  
- **Gemini AI** – natural language understanding and recommendations  
- **TailwindCSS** – clean, responsive styling  
- **Bolt** – rapid prototyping  
- **Netlify** – hosting and deployment
